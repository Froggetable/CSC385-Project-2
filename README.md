# CSC385-Project-2

This code seeks to resolve the Dining Philosopher's program using semaphores and mutex locks in C. <br/>
<br/>
The solution used in the program is the Resource Hierarchy solution, focusing on the forks with the lowest id to prevent deadlock scenarios where each philosopher would be holding one fork and awaiting another. <br/>
